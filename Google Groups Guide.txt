				1. Total external recipients per group=Maximum number of external recipients for group messages = 5,000 per day.
				         a. This means that the maximum is 5,000 recipients in 1 Google Group e-mail message per day (or its equivalent).
				3. If at some point we have more than 5,000 active scholars, we will have to repeat the process (i.e create another Google Group, and so on)
                         a. Dr. Joseph will have to log in to all the associated Google Groups to send the same announcement to everyone.
